Acho (a cute pup) tells you the title of the current page on your browser. A sample chrome extension.

This repo was created as an example for a series of articles I'm writing about Chrome extensions. Each folder inside the root folder contains a single chrome extension related to one of the articles in the series:

- Folder: `01-simple-example` was created for the article: [Creating a simple Chrome extension](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/creating-a-simple-chrome-extension-36m)
- Folder: `02-adding-commands` was created for the article: [Adding shortcuts to your Chrome Extension](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/adding-shortcuts-to-your-chrome-extension-2i20)
- Folder: `03-content-scripts` was created for the article: [Making changes to a web page](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/chrome-extensions-making-changes-to-a-web-page-1n5f)
- Folder: `04-reuse-scripts` was create for the article: [Chrome extensions: Reusing code](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/chrome-extensions-reusing-code-3f1g)
